# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Overview

In this project I used real-time data form the United States Geological Survey website to gather earthquake data from the past 7 days to plot onto a map using Leaflet. On my map, I plotted earthquake locations with different sizes based on their reported magnitudes and then different colors based on their reported density. Finally, I included a legend to make the mapping more easily read.
